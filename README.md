# 🧮 Scientific Calculator  

## ✨ Introduction  
This project is a **Scientific Calculator**, developed with the knowledge I have gained from SoftUni. The graphical user interface (GUI) is inspired by various online tutorials, articles, and videos. The core logic behind the interaction between `Calculator` and `CalculatorGUI` was refined with the help of ChatGPT, as I had hard time writing the code and finding the proper way to structure the logic.

🚧 **Work in Progress:** Further improvements in design and additional features are planned.
